BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE name = 'Alice';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Bob';
COMMIT;

SELECT * FROM accounts;

-- a) Final balances:
-- Alice: 1000 - 100 = 900
-- Bob: 500 + 100 = 600
--b) Both UPDATE statements must be in one transaction because
-- a money transfer is one logical action. If one part succeeds and the other fails, the database becomes inconsistent.
--c) If the system crashed between the two UPDATE statements (without a transaction),
-- Alice would lose 100 but Bob would not receive money. This creates an incorrect state.

-- 3.3
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE name = 'Alice';
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';   -- before rollback
ROLLBACK;

SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';   -- after rollback

--a) After the UPDATE but before ROLLBACK, Alice’s balance = 1000 - 500 = 500.
--b) After ROLLBACK, Alice’s balance returns to 1000.00.
--c) You use ROLLBACK when:
-- you updated the wrong data,
-- wrong amount,
-- validation failed,
-- unexpected error happened.
--It safely undoes all temporary changes.

BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE name = 'Alice';

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Bob';
-- wrong transfer → undo Bob
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;
-- correct transfer
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Wally';
COMMIT;

SELECT * FROM accounts;

--a) Final balances:
-- Alice: 1000 - 100 = 900
-- Bob: 500 (unchanged in final state)
-- Wally: 750 + 100 = 850
--b) Bob was credited temporarily, but this update was undone with ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT. Therefore, Bob ends up unchanged.
--c) SAVEPOINT allows undoing only part of a transaction instead of cancelling everything. Convenient when one step is wrong, but the rest is correct.

-- 3.5 TASK 4 – ISOLATION LEVEL DEMO (RUN IN 2 TERMINALS)
-- TERMINAL 1:
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE shop='Joe''s Shop';
-- SELECT * again after Terminal 2 COMMIT;
COMMIT;

-- TERMINAL 2:
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM products WHERE shop='Joe''s Shop';
INSERT INTO products(shop,product,price)
VALUES ('Joe''s Shop','Fanta',3.50);
COMMIT;

--Scenario A — READ COMMITTED:
--a) Terminal 1 sees:
--Before Terminal 2 commits → Coke, Pepsi
--After Terminal 2 commits → Fanta
--READ COMMITTED always shows the latest committed data.
--Scenario B — SERIALIZABLE:
--b) Terminal 1 only sees Coke, Pepsi.
--It does NOT see new changes during the transaction.
--c) Difference:
-- READ COMMITTED: every SELECT sees newly committed data.
-- SERIALIZABLE: transaction behaves as if it runs alone; no other changes are visible.

-- 3.6
-- TERMINAL 1:
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SELECT MAX(price), MIN(price) FROM products WHERE shop='Joe''s Shop';
-- SELECT MAX(price), MIN(price) again after Terminal 2 insert
COMMIT;

-- TERMINAL 2:
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO products(shop,product,price)
VALUES ('Joe''s Shop','Sprite',4.00);
COMMIT;

--a) No, Terminal 1 does NOT see the new product inserted by Terminal 2.
-- REPEATABLE READ freezes the result set for the entire transaction.
--b) A phantom read happens when new rows appear in the result of the same query during a transaction.
-- Example: MAX price changes because someone inserts a new row.
--c) SERIALIZABLE is the only isolation level that prevents phantom reads completely.

-- 3.7
-- TERMINAL 1:
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE shop='Joe''s Shop';
-- SELECT * again while Terminal 2 UPDATED but NOT committed;
-- SELECT * after Terminal 2 ROLLBACK
COMMIT;

-- TERMINAL 2:
BEGIN;
UPDATE products SET price=99.99 WHERE product='Fanta';
ROLLBACK;

--a) Yes, Terminal 1 sees the price 99.99. This is a dirty read because Terminal 2 has not committed the change yet and later rolls it back. Terminal 1 works with data that never truly existed.
--b) A dirty read means reading uncommitted (temporary) changes from another transaction.
--c) READ UNCOMMITTED should be avoided because it can show incorrect, temporary, or inconsistent data. This can lead to wrong results and broken business logic.



-- 4. INDEPENDENT EXERCISE 1
-- Transfer $200 from Bob to Wally IF Bob has enough money
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF (SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name='Bob') >= 200 THEN
        BEGIN
            UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE name='Bob';
            UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE name='Wally';
            RAISE NOTICE 'Transfer successful';
        END;
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Transfer failed: insufficient funds';
    END IF;
END $$;
SELECT * FROM accounts;

-- 4. INDEPENDENT EXERCISE 2
-- SAVEPOINT DEMO WITH INSERT → UPDATE → DELETE → ROLLBACK
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO products(shop,product,price)
VALUES ('Demo Shop','Tea',1.00);
SAVEPOINT sp1;
UPDATE products SET price=2.50 WHERE product='Tea';
SAVEPOINT sp2;
DELETE FROM products WHERE product='Tea';
ROLLBACK TO sp1;
COMMIT;
SELECT * FROM products;



-- 4. INDEPENDENT EXERCISE 3
-- Simultaneous withdrawals (conceptual example only)
-- TERMINAL 1:
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 300 WHERE name='Alice';
COMMIT;

-- TERMINAL 2:
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 300 WHERE name='Alice';
COMMIT;

-- Under SERIALIZABLE, second transaction would fail.


-- 4. INDEPENDENT EXERCISE 4
--Demonstrate MAX < MIN problem without transactions
-- BAD SESSION 1:
SELECT MAX(price) FROM products WHERE shop='Joe''s Shop';

-- Meanwhile SESSION 2 deletes rows

-- BAD RESULT: MAX < MIN possible

-- GOOD (WITH TRANSACTION):
BEGIN;
SELECT MAX(price), MIN(price) FROM products WHERE shop='Joe''s Shop';
COMMIT;

/*
1. ACID Properties:
   Atomic – all or nothing (bank transfer).
   Consistent – DB always stays valid (constraints).
   Isolated – transactions don't see each other's work.
   Durable – changes remain after crash.

2. COMMIT saves changes permanently,
   ROLLBACK cancels all changes.

3. SAVEPOINT is used to undo only part of a transaction.

4. Levels:
   • Read Uncommitted – dirty reads
   • Read Committed – no dirty reads
   • Repeatable Read – no non-repeatable reads
   • Serializable – fully isolated

5. Dirty read = seeing uncommitted data (allowed in READ UNCOMMITTED).

6. Non-repeatable read:
   You read a row twice and it changed in between.

7. Phantom read:
